# 1- Values, Types and Operators

## Values

- A value is a piece of data that can be stored in a variable, passed to a function, or otherwise manipulated by your program. All data in a computer is fundamentally stored as sequences of bits (zeros and ones), and in a JavaScript environment, these chunks of data are organized into distinct categories called types, which determine their role and behavior within the language.

## Special Numbers

- There are `three special` numbers in Js. <br>
  First two are `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.<br> The next one is `NaN`(Not a Number.)<br>
  You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate 0 / 0 (zero divided
  by zero), Infinity- Infinity, or any number of other numeric operations that
  don’t yield a meaningful result.

## String

- Strings are used to represent text.<br>
- How do we access/initialise a string??<br>
  By `single, double quotes and Backticks`.<br>
  For e.g., "oyeee", 'oyee', \`oyee`.<br>
